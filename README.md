## Description:
The Music Directory is a streaming service that allows users to have a personalized experience when it comes to listening to music. The user has the ability to create their own playlists, highlight their favorite artists, and upload their own music if they are a musician themselves. The Music Directory will be available on all operating systems, it can run as an application on both computers and cellular devices. In addition, the Music Directory can be operated on the official website as well if the user is away from their personal devices. The Music Directory is beneficial for our organization because one of our very own engineers, Abed Islam, is a musical artist himself. He has noticed the disparity between local artists in comparison to popular famous artists and how it's imperative to make it easy to bridge the gap between the two major groups. This will give local aspiring artists the opportunity to connect with artists that inspire them and gives major artists the ability to give hands-on mentoring services and a personal connection between an audience that shares a common interest with them: making music.
